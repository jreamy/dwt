# Keras Discrete Wavelet Transform Implementations

The goal of this project is to port some code from a prior research project into a usable library that implements the Discrete Wavelet Transform in Keras for use in machine learning projects. I'll primarily be drawing from the [pywt](https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for determining correctness.

## Wavelets

Currently only the orthogonal wavelets work, but I plan on adding support for the biorthogonal wavelets.

## Dependencies
 - pywt
